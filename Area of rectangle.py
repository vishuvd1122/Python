# Program to calculate the area of rectangle using its formula i.e. length*breadth
l = float(input("Enter length of a rectangle:"))
b = float(input("Enter breadth of a rectangle:"))
area = l*b
print("Area of rectangle with length and breadth of", l, "units and", b, "units respectively:", area, "sq. units")
